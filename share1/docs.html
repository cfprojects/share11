<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>
Before you can use the CFC, you must have 4 pieces of information:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>You need a username and password for an account at <a href="http://share.adobe.com">Share</a>.</li>
	<li>You need a developer key and shared secret. This may be found on the <a href="http://api.share.adobe.com/">Share Developer Site</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The developer key and shared secret are used to connect from ColdFusion to the Share service. The username and password
is the account that is accessed by the ColdFusion code. You can connect to any account you have a username or password for, 
but must use the developer key and shared secret to first creation that connection.
</p>

<p>
To begin using the CFC, you must create an instance of the CFC and call the INIT method. The init
method takes four arguments: username, password, developer key, and shared secret. The init method
will then connect to the Share service. In order for futher operations to work, you <b>must</b>
continue to work with this CFC. That means you should store the CFC in a persistant scope, like
the Application scope. Here is an example:	
</p>

<p>
<code>
&lt;cfif not isDefined("application.share")&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;cfset application.share = createObject("component", "share").init(username,password,appkey,sharedsecret)&gt;<br />
&lt;/cfif&gt;<br />
</code>
</p>

This sample checks to see if the Application variable share exists. If not, it creates an instance
and calls the init method all in one. The four values above represent variables that store the relevant
connection information.
