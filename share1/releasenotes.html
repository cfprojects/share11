<h1>ShareCFC Release Notes</h1>

<h3>January 12, 2011</h3>

It has been a while since I've been able to work on this API. A user, Stephen Cassady, did a LOT of work and has signficantly updated the CFC. I'm pasting in his notes below. All credit
goes to him.

1. After a month (with the most useless customer support I've ever had, and
no way to escalate the issue to anyone actually involved in the API, and
their response being quote "I would like to inform you that this the best
which we can help you. We
would request you please contact to the devnet regarding the same as it
seems that this is a programming related issue.") I've been able to figure
out what the issue was:

The API supported (upto mid December) URL was:
https://api.share.acrobat.com/webservices/index.do

Without any notification, this was shut down. The new URL the API calls is:
https://api.acroboat.com/webservices/index.do

The attached update code has the new URL.

2. Yes, the code attached not only has the fix for the above, but includes a
problem with ColdFusion and XML documents for CFHTTP. As outlined in this
thread here:
http://forums.adobe.com/thread/557943?decorator=print&displayFullThread=true
I found that (at least under CF8, fully patched) that the order of FormField
or Body could cause errors in the XML file (CF would modify the last few
characters of the XML file making it fail - likely replacing a correct end
of file character). By reversing the order that the original share.cfc uses
(the attached file is correct), the CFHTTP didn't mess with XML files
anymore. An interesting edge case that was a PAIN to identify correctly.

3. I've added a catch for "NoTOU" - another undocumented return which
requires the account to log into the web site and accept an updated Terms of
Service (yup, the API stops working until you log back in and accept new TOS
- but there isn't any communication to the API people about this and
required further work to discover).

So the attached file fixes IS AN UPDATE to the existing share, fixing 3
issues - (1) the wrong API url, (2) The CFHTTP bug for XML files, and (3) A
NoTOU catch with an explanation for new users of this CFC.
